Hi, I'm @Helelelu!

I'm a student of Computer Engineering and is a beginner in coding.
My current goal is to hone my skills in HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and other Web-Based Languages.
I hope I could learn more from school, and of course from other people here in GitHUb!

You can also check some of my projects here. They're some of my requirements for my school subjects and are rather unpolished, but I will do my best to make them even better!
